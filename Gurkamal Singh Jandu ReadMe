Gurkamal's Detailed Plan
Learning Steps:
Text Generation and NLP
Introduction to NLP:

Resource: Coursera: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
Goal: Understand the basics of NLP, including tokenization, vector spaces, and classification.
Working with Pre-trained Models:

Resource: Hugging Face Transformers Documentation
Goal: Learn how to use pre-trained models like GPT-3 or GPT-4. Understand how to fine-tune these models for specific tasks like generating text.
Advanced Text Generation Techniques:

Resource: Text Generation with Transformers
Goal: Explore techniques for text generation, including beam search, sampling, and controlling model outputs (e.g., tone, length).
Working Steps:
Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-4)
Week 1:

Task: Research pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3) and experiment with generating text.
Output: A basic understanding of how text generation works and which models are most suitable for your project.
Week 2:

Task: Set up a basic text generation model using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library.
Output: A functional API that can generate text based on input prompts.
Week 3-4:

Task: Enhance the text generation model with customization options like tone and length. Start integrating the model into a simple front-end UI.
Output: A customizable text generation feature ready for further testing and improvement.
Phase 2: Advanced Development (Weeks 5-8)
Week 5-6:

Task: Implement advanced features like style transfer and tone adjustment. Fine-tune the model based on specific content types (e.g., blog posts, social media captions).
Output: A more sophisticated text generation model with advanced features.
Week 7-8:

Task: Conduct user testing to gather feedback. Use this feedback to refine the model and improve the user interface.
Output: A polished text generation feature ready for integration.
Phase 3: Polishing and Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
Week 9-10:

Task: Focus on optimizing the text generation model for speed and reliability. Conduct stress testing to ensure the model can handle multiple requests simultaneously.
Output: A highly optimized and reliable text generation model.
Week 11-12:

Task: Finalize testing and prepare documentation for the text generation feature. Ensure all code is well-documented and ready for handover.
Output: Comprehensive documentation and a fully tested text generation component.
Phase 4: Deployment and Post-Launch (Weeks 13-16)
Week 13-14:

Task: Deploy the text generation model to the production environment. Begin monitoring performance and address any issues that arise.
Output: A deployed text generation service ready for use by end-users.
Week 15-16:

Task: Collect feedback from users and plan future improvements. Consider expanding the text generation feature based on user needs.
Output: A roadmap for future updates and improvements.

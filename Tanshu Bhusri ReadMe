Tanshu's Detailed Plan
Learning Steps:
Model Optimization and Deployment
Introduction to Model Optimization:

Resource: TensorFlow Model Optimization Guide
Goal: Learn the basics of model optimization, including quantization, pruning, and other techniques to improve model performance.
Working with Docker and Cloud Deployment:

Resource: Docker for Beginners and AWS Deployment Guide
Goal: Understand how to containerize applications using Docker and deploy them to cloud platforms like AWS.
Monitoring and Scaling Models:

Resource: Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring and Grafana Tutorials
Goal: Learn how to monitor deployed models using Prometheus and Grafana, and scale them as needed.
Working Steps:
Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-4)
Week 1:

Task: Research optimization techniques like pruning and quantization. Experiment with optimizing small models to understand the impact.
Output: A foundational understanding of model optimization techniques.
Week 2:

Task: Set up a Docker environment for containerizing the text and image generation models. Begin integrating these models into a simple deployment pipeline.
Output: A Dockerized environment ready for further development and testing.
Week 3-4:

Task: Continue optimizing the text and image models, focusing on reducing latency and improving throughput. Test the models within the Docker environment.
Output: Optimized models ready for integration and deployment.
Phase 2: Advanced Development (Weeks 5-8)
Week 5-6:

Task: Begin integrating the optimized models into a web application. Ensure that the text and image APIs work seamlessly together.
Output: A web application with integrated and optimized text and image generation models.
Week 7-8:

Task: Conduct full integration testing to ensure all components work together smoothly. Address any performance or integration issues.
Output: A fully integrated application ready for final testing and deployment.
Phase 3: Polishing and Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
Week 9-10:

Task: Finalize the deployment setup, ensuring that all components are ready for production. Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Output: A deployment environment with monitoring and alerting capabilities.
Week 11-12:

Task: Conduct final testing on the deployed application. Ensure that all monitoring tools are functioning correctly and that the application is scalable.
Output: A fully tested and monitored application ready for launch.
Phase 4: Deployment and Post-Launch (Weeks 13-16)
Week 13-14:

Task: Deploy the application to the production environment. Provide support for any deployment issues and ensure that all services are running smoothly.
Output: A live application with all services deployed and operational.
Week 15-16:

Task: Continue monitoring the application and models. Make any necessary optimizations and assist in planning future updates.
Output: An optimized, monitored application with a roadmap for future improvements.

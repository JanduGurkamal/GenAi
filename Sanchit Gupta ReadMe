Sanchit's Detailed Plan
Learning Steps:
Image Generation and GANs
Introduction to GANs:

Resource: Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (Course 5: Generative Adversarial Networks)
Goal: Understand the basics of GANs, including how they generate images and how to train them.
Working with Pre-trained Image Models:

Resource: StyleGAN2 for Image Generation
Goal: Learn how to use pre-trained GANs like StyleGAN2 for image generation tasks.
Image Processing and Enhancement:

Resource: OpenCV Documentation
Goal: Learn image processing techniques using OpenCV, including image enhancement, filtering, and transformations.
Working Steps:
Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-4)
Week 1:

Task: Research image generation techniques like GANs and DALL-E. Begin experimenting with generating images based on text prompts.
Output: A solid understanding of image generation techniques and initial experimentation results.
Week 2:

Task: Set up a basic image generation model using a pre-trained GAN. Develop a simple API that generates images based on input prompts.
Output: A functional image generation API ready for further development.
Week 3-4:

Task: Enhance the image generation module by experimenting with style transfer and other advanced techniques. Integrate these features into the API.
Output: An advanced image generation feature with style transfer capabilities.
Phase 2: Advanced Development (Weeks 5-8)
Week 5-6:

Task: Combine text and image generation to create a meme generation feature. Implement UI elements that allow users to create memes easily.
Output: A fully functional meme generation feature integrated with the image and text generation APIs.
Week 7-8:

Task: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the image and meme generation features. Use this feedback to refine the models and improve the user interface.
Output: A polished image and meme generation feature ready for deployment.
Phase 3: Polishing and Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
Week 9-10:

Task: Optimize the image generation model for performance, ensuring it works well on different devices. Test across various platforms (desktop, mobile).
Output: A highly optimized image generation model ready for production use.
Week 11-12:

Task: Finalize testing and prepare documentation for the image generation feature. Ensure all code is well-documented and easy to understand.
Output: Comprehensive documentation and a fully tested image generation component.
Phase 4: Deployment and Post-Launch (Weeks 13-16)
Week 13-14:

Task: Deploy the image generation model to the production environment. Begin monitoring performance and address any issues that arise.
Output: A deployed image generation service ready for use by end-users.
Week 15-16:

Task: Collect feedback from users and plan future improvements. Consider expanding the image generation feature based on user needs.
Output: A roadmap for future updates and improvements.
